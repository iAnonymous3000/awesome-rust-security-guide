## Introduction

Rust is a systems programming language that prioritizes safety, concurrency, and memory efficiency. Its unique features make it an attractive choice for security and privacy-sensitive applications. Rust's growing adoption in the security and privacy industry can be attributed to its ability to prevent common vulnerabilities and ensure secure development practices.

This guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Rust's security features and best practices for security and privacy researchers. Whether you're new to Rust or an experienced developer looking to leverage Rust for security-critical applications, this guide offers valuable insights and practical advice.

---

## 1. Memory Safety

One of Rust's primary strengths is its focus on memory safety. It prevents common memory-related vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, and use-after-free errors, through its ownership system and borrow checker.

### 1.1 Ownership

- Each value in Rust has an owner responsible for its memory allocation and deallocation.
- Ownership follows a set of rules:
  - Each value can have only one owner at a time.
  - When the owner goes out of scope, the value is automatically deallocated.
- Ownership prevents issues like double frees and use-after-free vulnerabilities.

**Example:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1; // Ownership of the string moves to s2

    // println!("{}", s1); // This would cause a compile-time error
    println!("{}", s2); // This is valid
}
```

### 1.2 Borrowing

- Rust allows borrowing of values through references.
- References come in two forms: shared references (`&T`) and mutable references (`&mut T`).
- The borrow checker enforces the following rules:
  - Either one mutable reference or any number of shared references can exist at a time, but not both simultaneously.
  - References must not outlive the borrowed value.
- Borrowing ensures data race freedom and prevents issues like null pointer dereferences.

**Example:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    {
        let r1 = &s; // Shared reference
        let r2 = &s; // Another shared reference
        println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
        // r1 and r2 go out of scope here
    }

    {
        let r3 = &mut s; // Mutable reference
        r3.push_str(", world");
        println!("{}", r3);
        // r3 goes out of scope here
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

By introducing inner scopes `{ ... }`, we ensure that the immutable references `r1` and `r2` are no longer in use when we create the mutable reference `r3`. This complies with Rust's borrowing rules.

### 1.3 Lifetimes

- Lifetimes express the scope and duration of references.
- Rust's borrow checker uses lifetimes to ensure that references are valid and do not outlive the referenced data.
- Lifetimes prevent dangling references and use-after-free vulnerabilities.

**Example:**

```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}

fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("short");
    let s2 = String::from("longer");
    let result = longest(s1.as_str(), s2.as_str());
    println!("Longest string: {}", result);
}
```

**Real-World Example:**

In 2019, a vulnerability was discovered in the popular SSH client library, libssh2, which allowed attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access. The vulnerability was caused by a use-after-free error in the library's code. Had the library been written in Rust, the ownership system and borrow checker would have prevented this vulnerability by ensuring proper memory management and ownership rules.

---

## 2. Safe Concurrency

Rust's ownership system and type system enable safe and efficient concurrent programming.

### 2.1 Threads

- Rust provides a standard library for creating and managing threads.
- The `std::thread` module allows spawning new threads and provides synchronization primitives like mutexes and channels.
- Rust's ownership system ensures thread safety by preventing data races.

**Example:**

```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..10 {
            println!("Thread: number {}", i);
        }
    });

    for i in 1..5 {
        println!("Main: number {}", i);
    }

    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```

### 2.2 Synchronization Primitives

- Rust offers various synchronization primitives in the `std::sync` module.
- Mutexes (`Mutex<T>`) allow exclusive access to shared data.
- Read-Write Locks (`RwLock<T>`) provide concurrent read access and exclusive write access.
- Channels (`std::sync::mpsc`) enable safe communication between threads.

**Example using a mutex:**

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for _ in 0..10 {
        let counter = Arc::clone(&counter);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();
            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    println!("Result: {}", *counter.lock().unwrap());
}
```

### 2.3 Send and Sync Traits

- Rust uses the `Send` and `Sync` traits to ensure thread safety of types.
- A type is `Send` if it can be safely transferred between threads.
- A type is `Sync` if it can be safely shared between threads.
- The compiler enforces these traits, preventing potential concurrency bugs.

**Example:**

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::sync::Arc;

fn main() {
    let a = 5;
    let b = String::from("Hello");
    let c = vec![1, 2, 3];

    std::thread::spawn(move || {
        println!("{}, {}, {:?}", a, b, c);
    });

    // Rc is not Send
    let rc = Rc::new(42);
    // Uncommenting the following line would result in a compile-time error
    // std::thread::spawn(move || println!("{}", rc));

    // Arc is both Send and Sync
    let arc = Arc::new(42);
    std::thread::spawn(move || println!("{}", arc));
}
```

For more information on Rust's concurrency features, see the [official documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-00-concurrency.html).

---

## 3. Safe FFI and Interoperability

Rust provides mechanisms for safe interaction with foreign code and systems.

### 3.1 Foreign Function Interface (FFI)

- Rust allows calling functions from other languages (e.g., C) and being called by other languages.
- The `extern` keyword is used to declare external functions and link to foreign libraries.
- Rust's ownership system and type safety extend to FFI boundaries, preventing common pitfalls.

**Example of calling a C function from Rust:**

```rust
use std::os::raw::c_int;

#[link(name = "m")]
extern "C" {
    fn abs(input: c_int) -> c_int;
}

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        let result = abs(-42);
        println!("Absolute value of -42: {}", result);
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Unsafe Code

- Rust allows unsafe code blocks (`unsafe { ... }`) for low-level operations and interacting with foreign code.
- Unsafe code is necessary for certain tasks but should be minimized and carefully reviewed.
- Unsafe code is encapsulated within safe abstractions to maintain overall program safety.

**Example of using unsafe code to dereference a raw pointer:**

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut num = 5;

    let r1 = &num as *const i32;
    let r2 = &mut num as *mut i32;

    unsafe {
        println!("r1 is: {}", *r1);
        *r2 += 1;
        println!("r2 is: {}", *r2);
    }
}
```

For more information on unsafe code in Rust, see the [official documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html).

### 3.3 Bindgen

- [Bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen) is a tool that automatically generates Rust FFI bindings from C/C++ header files.
- It simplifies the process of interfacing with existing libraries and reduces the risk of manual errors.

**Example of using Bindgen (requires the `bindgen` crate):**

```rust
use std::path::PathBuf;

fn main() {
    let bindings = bindgen::Builder::default()
        .header("wrapper.h")
        .generate()
        .expect("Unable to generate bindings");

    let out_path = PathBuf::from("bindings.rs");
    bindings
        .write_to_file(out_path)
        .expect("Couldn't write bindings!");
}
```

### 3.4 FFI Challenges

- When dealing with C/C++ interoperability, it's important to be aware of specific challenges, such as ensuring null pointer checks when working with C strings.
- Rust's type system and ownership model can help mitigate these challenges, but careful attention and proper handling are still required.

**Example of safely handling a C string:**

```rust
use std::ffi::CStr;
use std::os::raw::c_char;

extern "C" {
    fn get_c_string() -> *const c_char;
}

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        let c_str = get_c_string();
        if !c_str.is_null() {
            let rust_str = CStr::from_ptr(c_str).to_str().unwrap();
            println!("Received string: {}", rust_str);
        } else {
            println!("Received null pointer");
        }
    }
}
```

---

## 4. Security Auditing and Analysis

Rust's strong type system and ownership model aid in security auditing and analysis.

### 4.1 Type System

- Rust's expressive type system allows encoding invariants and constraints into the types themselves.
- The type system catches many common programming errors at compile-time.
- Rust's enums and pattern matching facilitate secure and exhaustive handling of different cases.

**Example of using enums for secure state handling:**

```rust
enum ConnectionState {
    Disconnected,
    Connecting,
    Connected(String),
    Error(String),
}

fn handle_connection(state: ConnectionState) {
    match state {
        ConnectionState::Disconnected => println!("Not connected"),
        ConnectionState::Connecting => println!("Establishing connection..."),
        ConnectionState::Connected(addr) => println!("Connected to {}", addr),
        ConnectionState::Error(msg) => println!("Connection error: {}", msg),
    }
}

fn main() {
    let state = ConnectionState::Connected("192.168.1.1".to_string());
    handle_connection(state);
}
```

### 4.2 Ownership Analysis

- The ownership system provides a clear model of resource management and lifetimes.
- Analyzing ownership and lifetimes helps identify potential security issues and ensures proper resource handling.

### 4.3 Static Analysis Tools

- Rust has a growing ecosystem of static analysis tools that aid in security auditing.
- Tools like [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) and [Rust Analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer) provide linting, code analysis, and vulnerability detection.
- These tools complement manual code review and help catch potential security flaws early in the development process.

**Example of using Clippy:**

```bash
cargo clippy
```

### 4.4 Limitations and Complementary Approaches

- While static analysis tools are valuable, they have limitations and blind spots.
- It's important to complement static analysis with manual code review and dynamic analysis techniques.
- Combining multiple analysis approaches ensures a more thorough security audit.

---

## 5. Secure Cryptography

Rust has a robust ecosystem of cryptographic libraries that prioritize security and correctness.

### 5.1 RustCrypto

- [RustCrypto](https://github.com/RustCrypto) is a collection of high-quality cryptographic algorithms and primitives implemented in Rust.
- It provides a wide range of cryptographic functionalities, including symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hashing, and digital signatures.
- RustCrypto libraries are designed with a focus on security, performance, and usability.

**Example of using RustCrypto for SHA-256 hashing:**

```rust
use sha2::{Sha256, Digest};

fn main() {
    let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
    hasher.update(b"hello world");
    let result = hasher.finalize();
    println!("SHA-256 hash: {:x}", result);
}
```

### 5.2 Auditing and Verification

- Rust's strong type system and ownership model facilitate formal verification and auditing of cryptographic implementations.
- The Rust language and its ecosystem promote a culture of security audits and peer review.
- Many RustCrypto libraries have undergone security audits and formal verification to ensure their correctness and security.

For more information on secure cryptography in Rust, see the [RustCrypto repository](https://github.com/RustCrypto) and the [Rust Cryptography Libraries](https://lib.rs/cryptography) on Lib.rs.

## 6. Privacy-Preserving Technologies

Rust's safety guarantees and performance make it well-suited for implementing privacy-preserving technologies.

### 6.1 Zero-Knowledge Proofs

- Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) allow proving statements without revealing additional information.
- Rust's safety and performance characteristics make it a good choice for implementing ZKP systems.
- Libraries like [Bellman](https://github.com/zkcrypto/bellman) and [Arkworks](https://github.com/arkworks-rs) provide building blocks for constructing ZKP circuits and protocols.

**Example of using Bellman for a simple ZKP:**

```rust
use bellman::{Circuit, ConstraintSystem, SynthesisError};
use bellman::groth16::{create_random_proof, generate_random_parameters, prepare_verifying_key, verify_proof};
use bls12_381::Bls12;
use rand::rngs::OsRng;

// Define a simple circuit
struct MyCircuit {
    x: Option<u64>,
}

impl Circuit<Bls12> for MyCircuit {
    fn synthesize<CS: ConstraintSystem<Bls12>>(self, cs: &mut CS) -> Result<(), SynthesisError> {
        let x = cs.alloc(|| "x", || self.x.ok_or(SynthesisError::AssignmentMissing))?;
        cs.enforce(
            || "x * x = x",
            |lc| lc + x,
            |lc| lc + x,
            |lc| lc + x,
        );
        Ok(())
    }
}

fn main() {
    let params = {
        let c = MyCircuit { x: None };
        generate_random_parameters(c, &mut OsRng).unwrap()
    };
    let pvk = prepare_verifying_key(&params.vk);

    let circuit = MyCircuit { x: Some(1) };
    let proof = create_random_proof(circuit, &params, &mut OsRng).unwrap();

    assert!(verify_proof(&pvk, &proof, &[]).is_ok());
}
```

### 6.2 Secure Multi-Party Computation

- Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function without revealing their inputs.
- Rust's memory safety and concurrency features are beneficial for implementing MPC protocols.
- Libraries like [KZen Networks' multi-party ECDSA](https://github.com/KZen-networks/ecdsa-mpc) and [frost](https://github.com/serai-dex/frost) showcase Rust's potential in the MPC domain.

**Example of using Paillier encryption for MPC:**

```rust
use paillier::*;
use paillier::unknown_order::BigNumber;

fn main() {
    let (ek, dk) = Paillier::keypair().keys();

    let m1 = BigNumber::from(10u64);
    let m2 = BigNumber::from(20u64);

    let c1 = Paillier::encrypt(&ek, &m1);
    let c2 = Paillier::encrypt(&ek, &m2);

    let c_sum = Paillier::add(&ek, &c1, &c2);

    let decrypted_sum = Paillier::decrypt(&dk, &c_sum);
    assert_eq!(decrypted_sum, BigNumber::from(30u64));
}
```

### 6.3 Homomorphic Encryption

- Homomorphic Encryption (HE) enables computations on encrypted data without decryption.
- Rust's performance and safety make it a suitable language for implementing HE schemes.
- Libraries like [concrete](https://github.com/zama-ai/concrete) and [tfhe-rs](https://github.com/tfhe/tfhe-rs) implement various HE primitives and schemes.

---

## 7. Secure Coding Practices in Rust

Rust's design encourages secure coding practices, but it's still important to follow best practices and be mindful of potential pitfalls.

### 7.1 Input Validation and Sanitization

- Always validate and sanitize external inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- Use Rust's type system and libraries to enforce strict input validation and sanitization.
- Be cautious when using unsafe code or interacting with untrusted data.

**Example of input validation:**

```rust
use regex::Regex;

fn validate_username(username: &str) -> bool {
    let re = Regex::new(r"^[a-zA-Z0-9_]{3,20}$").unwrap();
    re.is_match(username)
}

fn main() {
    let valid_username = "john_doe123";
    let invalid_username = "user@name";

    println!("Valid username: {}", validate_username(valid_username));
    println!("Invalid username: {}", validate_username(invalid_username));
}
```

### 7.2 Error Handling

- Use Rust's error handling mechanisms, such as `Result` and `Option`, to explicitly handle errors and prevent unexpected behavior.
- Avoid unwrapping (`unwrap()`) or ignoring (`_`) errors, as this can lead to runtime panics or silent failures.
- Propagate errors to the caller or handle them gracefully to maintain program stability.

**Example of proper error handling:**

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_file_contents(path: &str) -> io::Result<String> {
    let mut file = File::open(path)?;
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;
    Ok(contents)
}

fn main() {
    match read_file_contents("example.txt") {
        Ok(contents) => println!("File contents: {}", contents),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("Error reading file: {}", e),
    }
}
```

### 7.3 Secure Randomness

- Use cryptographically secure random number generators for security-sensitive operations.
- Avoid using `rand::Rng` for cryptographic purposes unless it's backed by a secure source.
- Use libraries like `rand_core` with `OsRng` or `getrandom` for secure randomness.

**Example of using secure randomness:**

```rust
use rand::RngCore;
use rand::rngs::OsRng;

fn generate_secure_token() -> String {
    const CHARSET: &[u8] = b"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\
                            abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\
                            0123456789)(*&^%$#@!~";
    const TOKEN_LEN: usize = 32;
    let mut rng = OsRng;

    let token: String = (0..TOKEN_LEN)
        .map(|_| {
            let idx = (rng.next_u32() as usize) % CHARSET.len();
            CHARSET[idx] as char
        })
        .collect();

    token
}

fn main() {
    let secure_token = generate_secure_token();
    println!("Secure token: {}", secure_token);
}
```

### 7.4 Secure Configuration

- Store sensitive configuration data, such as API keys and passwords, securely.
- Avoid hardcoding secrets in the source code; instead, use environment variables or secure configuration management systems.
- Regularly rotate and update secrets to minimize the impact of potential breaches.

**Example of using environment variables for configuration:**

```rust
use std::env;

fn get_database_url() -> String {
    env::var("DATABASE_URL").unwrap_or_else(|_| {
        eprintln!("DATABASE_URL not set. Using default.");
        "postgres://localhost/myapp".to_string()
    })
}

fn main() {
    let db_url = get_database_url();
    println!("Using database URL: {}", db_url);
}
```

### 7.5 Dependency Management

- Keep dependencies up to date to ensure you have the latest security patches and bug fixes.
- Regularly audit and review dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like [`cargo-audit`](https://github.com/RustSec/rustsec/tree/main/cargo-audit).
- Pin dependencies to specific versions to prevent unexpected changes and ensure reproducible builds.

**Example of using `cargo-audit`:**

```bash
cargo install cargo-audit
cargo audit
```

For more secure coding guidelines, refer to the [Rust Security Guidelines](https://anssi-fr.github.io/rust-guide/) and the [Rust Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheats.rs/#cryptography-and-security).

## 8. Secure Networking

Rust's memory safety and concurrency features make it well-suited for building secure networked applications.

### 8.1 Secure Communication Protocols

- Implement secure communication protocols, such as TLS and SSH, using Rust's cryptographic libraries and networking primitives.
- Ensure proper authentication, confidentiality, and integrity of network communication.
- Follow best practices for secure protocol implementation and configuration.

**Updated Example using `rustls`:**

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::io::{Read, Write};
use rustls::{ClientConfig, ClientConnection, StreamOwned, RootCertStore};
use webpki::DNSNameRef;
use std::net::TcpStream;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut root_store = RootCertStore::empty();
    root_store.add_server_trust_anchors(webpki_roots::TLS_SERVER_ROOTS.0.iter().map(|ta| {
        let ta = webpki::TrustAnchor::try_from_cert_der(&ta.der).unwrap();
        rustls::OwnedTrustAnchor::from_subject_spki_name_constraints(
            ta.subject,
            ta.spki,
            ta.name_constraints,
        )
    }));
    let config = ClientConfig::builder()
        .with_safe_defaults()
        .with_root_certificates(root_store)
        .with_no_client_auth();
    let config = Arc::new(config);

    let server_name = DNSNameRef::try_from_ascii_str("example.com")?;
    let mut conn = ClientConnection::new(config, server_name.into())?;
    let mut sock = TcpStream::connect("example.com:443")?;
    let mut tls = StreamOwned::new(conn, sock);

    tls.write_all(b"GET / HTTP/1.0\r\nHost: example.com\r\n\r\n")?;
    let mut plaintext = Vec::new();
    tls.read_to_end(&mut plaintext)?;
    println!("Server response: {}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&plaintext));

    Ok(())
}
```

### 8.2 Authentication and Authorization

- Implement robust authentication mechanisms, such as token-based authentication or public-key cryptography.
- Use Rust's type system and libraries to enforce strict access controls and authorization checks.
- Protect against common authentication vulnerabilities, such as weak passwords, session hijacking, and improper session management.

**Example of a simple JWT-based authentication system:**

```rust
use jsonwebtoken::{encode, decode, Header, Validation, EncodingKey, DecodingKey, Algorithm};
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
use chrono::{Utc, Duration};

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Claims {
    sub: String,
    exp: usize,
}

fn create_token(user_id: &str, secret: &str) -> Result<String, jsonwebtoken::errors::Error> {
    let expiration = Utc::now()
        .checked_add_signed(Duration::hours(1))
        .expect("valid timestamp")
        .timestamp();

    let claims = Claims {
        sub: user_id.to_owned(),
        exp: expiration as usize,
    };

    encode(&Header::default(), &claims, &EncodingKey::from_secret(secret.as_ref()))
}

fn validate_token(token: &str, secret: &str) -> Result<Claims, jsonwebtoken::errors::Error> {
    let validation = Validation::new(Algorithm::HS256);
    let token_data = decode::<Claims>(token, &DecodingKey::from_secret(secret.as_ref()), &validation)?;
    Ok(token_data.claims)
}

fn main() {
    let secret = "your-secret-key";
    let user_id = "user123";

    match create_token(user_id, secret) {
        Ok(token) => {
            println!("Generated token: {}", token);
            match validate_token(&token, secret) {
                Ok(claims) => println!("Valid token for user: {}", claims.sub),
                Err(e) => println!("Token validation failed: {}", e),
            }
        }
        Err(e) => println!("Token creation failed: {}", e),
    }
}
```

### 8.3 Secure Network Programming Practices

- Validate and sanitize network inputs to prevent injection attacks and malformed data.
- Handle network errors and timeouts gracefully to prevent denial-of-service conditions.
- Use secure coding practices, such as input validation, error handling, and secure randomness, in network-related code.

#![no_main]
use libfuzzer_sys::fuzz_target;

fuzz_target!(|data: &[u8]| {
    if let Ok(s) = std::str::from_utf8(data) {
        let _ = s.parse::<u64>();
    }
});
```

**To set up fuzzing:**

```bash
cargo install cargo-fuzz
cargo fuzz init
cargo fuzz run fuzz_target_1
```

### 15.2 Property-Based Testing

```rust
use proptest::prelude::*;

fn reverse<T: Clone>(v: &[T]) -> Vec<T> {
    v.iter().rev().cloned().collect()
}

proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn test_reverse(v: Vec<i32>) {
        let reversed = reverse(&v);
        prop_assert_eq!(v.len(), reversed.len());
        prop_assert_eq!(v, reverse(&reversed));
    }
}
```

### 15.3 Penetration Testing

- Use newtypes and custom types to prevent common mistakes and ensure correct usage of your API.

**Example of using newtypes for secure API design:**

```rust
use std::fmt;

struct SensitiveData(String);

impl fmt::Debug for SensitiveData {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "SensitiveData([REDACTED])")
    }
}

fn process_sensitive_data(data: SensitiveData) {
    // Process the sensitive data securely
}

fn main() {
    let sensitive = SensitiveData(String::from("secret"));
    process_sensitive_data(sensitive);
    // println!("{:?}", sensitive); // This would not compile due to move semantics
}
```

### 16.2 Error Handling in APIs

- Design clear and informative error types that provide sufficient context without leaking sensitive information.
- Use the [`thiserror`](https://github.com/dtolnay/thiserror) crate for defining custom error types and the [`anyhow`](https://github.com/dtolnay/anyhow) crate for flexible error handling in application code.

**Example of custom error types:**

```rust
use thiserror::Error;

#[derive(Error, Debug)]
pub enum ApiError {
    #[error("Authentication failed")]
    AuthError,
    #[error("Resource not found")]
    NotFound,
    #[error("Internal server error: {0}")]
    InternalError(#[from] std::io::Error),
}

fn api_operation() -> Result<(), ApiError> {
    // Perform API operation
    Err(ApiError::AuthError)
}

fn main() {
    match api_operation() {
        Ok(_) => println!("Operation successful"),
        Err(e) => eprintln!("API error: {}", e),
    }
}
```

### 16.3 Secure Default Configurations

- Provide secure default configurations for your APIs and libraries.
- Make it easy for users to adopt secure practices and hard to accidentally use insecure options.
